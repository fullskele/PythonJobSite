# RecruitRush

This is a full-stack web app written with Python, Flask, and MySQL, recreating the core features of websites such as Indeed or LinkedIn, including display, creation, modification, and application of jobs. Following will be a brief walkthrough of most of the site's features.

# Creating an Account

When first visiting the website, you will be prompted to login before accessing the central dashboard.

As we don't have an account yet, let's click on 'Register Instead', and fill out the relevant information to make one:

After our account is created, logging in with the proper credentials will lead us to the dashboard:

# Applying to Jobs

Here we can see several job openings, sorted by date and skill-relevance. Let's apply to the 'Latest Relevant Job', which will display a popup to indicate that the application went through:

This job opening will now be hidden from the Dashboard tab, and we can find it (along with any other jobs we applied to) in the View Applied tab.

Let's now head to the 'Edit Account' tab, where we can add to and edit our account information, which will be seen in your applications by recruiters:

# Managing Job Postings

In this section, I'll be using a separate, pre-made 'recruiter' account to create and manage jobs. 

Firstly, the 'Create Posting' tab will allow us to make new job listings for workers to see:

We'll be able to view and edit any of our previously created postings in the 'Your Posts' tab:

Clicking on 'Edit' for the job named 'Latest Relevant Job', we can change all of the post's attributes, including whether it should be hidden from appearing to future applicants.

# Managing Applicants

Taking a look at the 'View Applicants' tab, we can see our application from the worker account has went through. From here we can choose to deny or approve this individual, which will send an appropriate message to their inbox based on your choice:

![image11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82c90504-8afa-4395-b7cc-ab6386cfba7e)

Choosing to approve this individual, we can see a confirmation has appeared, telling us that the approval was registered.

Approving an applicant will also set the job posting to 'closed' until manually edited. Returning back to our example worker account, let us now check on our Inbox messages.

# Inbox

At last, we can see that we have been approved to our desired position:
